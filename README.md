# DSA Repository

This repository contains self-practice implementations of algorithms and data structures written in **Python**, **Java**, and **C#...**

The purpose of this project is to build a strong understanding of fundamental problem-solving patterns and data structure design through hands-on coding practice.

> Note: The usage cases of all problems are writen by AI to give a relatively complete test to the algo problems / data structures, while the solution is written by myself and copied from LeetCode / HackerRank website after passing the tests.

## Link to My Notion Notes
[DSA Notes](https://www.notion.so/2b3cc953eadc8148b3cbe0b68baabcc3?v=2ddcc953eadc80118904000c14552e26&source=copy_link)
- This note is for review purpose with detailed explainations to questions.
- Contains the thoughts at the time I encounter them, with review questions to help me recall key concepts.
- Has the ability to redo prev questions and use Index to sort and group them.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Data_Structure_Review/
This directory contains core data structure implementations written for review and reinforcement of fundamental concepts.  

Each subfolder contains source code files in one or more languages (mainly Python and Java), along with small test programs demonstrating usage.

### 2. Problems/
This directory includes individual algorithm problems, each stored in its own folder.  
Each problem folder generally contains:
- One or more implementations of the same problem in Python, Java, or C#  
- Focus on time and space complexity efficiency  
- Clear function-oriented or class-based solutions

The goal is to maintain a consistent naming convention and a comparable style across languages for easier study and reference.

## How to Run

Each source file includes its own **usage case / test code**.
So most of the time you can simply run the file directly.

### Java
```bash
# from the folder that contains the file
javac FileName.java
java FileName
